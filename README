Once the engine included to your application Gemfile, run:

    bundle exec rake spree_atos:bootstrap

It will copy and run migrations, and create both "bin/atos" and "config/atos" directories.
You then need to copy Atos vendor binary files ("request", "response") inside the "bin/atos" directory and
Atos vendor config files ("parmcom.*", "pathfile") and certificates inside the "config/atos" directory.

Next, you need to update the "pathfile" file to reflect the following changes:

    D_LOGO!/assets/atos/!
    F_CERTIFICATE!config/atos/certif!
    F_PARAM!config/atos/parmcom!
    F_DEFAULT!config/atos/parmcom.VENDOR!

(where VENDOR is "sogenactif", "e-transactions", ...)'
